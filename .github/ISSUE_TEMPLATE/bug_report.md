<!--
Disclaimer on bugfixes:

Please note that the Dublr smart contract has been deployed without a proxy, so it cannot be changed, although in case of a security emergency, there are a small number of security controls that can limit financial loss.

Due to US SEC securities laws, in order to ensure that the DUBLR token is not classified as a security, the Dublr smart contract creator may only fix critical bugs in the Dublr dapp, and cannot implement material new features or other improvements. Furthermore, the fees collected from the Dublr DEX do not fund ongoing maintainership of the Dublr dapp or the Dublr smart contract. Any bugfixes that are implemented are implemented at will, on a pro bono basis (again, to respect securities laws).

Nevertheless, please report any and all bugs you find. Thank you.
